Going back!\", \"text\": \"First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It\\u2019s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I\\u2019m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I\\u2019m going to have to pay more.

Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage.

Moreover, it\\'s still paired with a Neural Engine chip for advanced machine learning.The iPad Pro\\'s display features the same Liquid Retina technology found on iPhones, and has a 2388 x 1668 resolution, ProMotion technology, wide color and True Tone support, as well as a 600 cd/m2 brightness rating. On the rear, Apple has added a 10MP ultra-wide camera, enabling different perspectives and multi-camera use. A newly added LiDAR scanner, which determines distance by determining light reflection, further readies possibilities for augmented reality and beyond.The iPad Pro now features five studio-quality microphones that capture clean audio and the quietest details.
